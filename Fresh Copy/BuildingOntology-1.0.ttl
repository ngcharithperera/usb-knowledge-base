	dcterms:description """The SEAS Building ontology describes a taxonomy of buildings, building spaces, and rooms.

Some categorizations are based on the energy efficiency related to their insulation etc., although the actual values for classes depend the country specific regulations and geographical locations.

Other categorizations are based on occupancy and activities. There is no single accepted categorization available. This taxonomy uses some types selected from:

- International building occupancy based categories (USA)
- The Classification of Types of Constructions (EU)
- Finnish building categorization VTJ2000 (Finland)
- Wikipedia category page for Rooms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Rooms

This ontology should limit the overlap with the following existing specialized ontologies:

- [FIEMSER ontology](http://sites.google.com/site/smartappliancesproject/ontologies/fiemser#).
- [gbXML ontology](http://www.gbxml.org/).
- [ifcOWL ontology](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifcOWL/IFC4), which is a OWL version of the Building Information Model standard.
- the potential ontology that might be developed in the context of the [Linked Building Data community group](https://www.w3.org/community/lbd/), or its successor Working Group.
